Assignment #4 Report:
-------------------

This assignment took about 5 hours to get Keil v5 debugging into my 1-line "Blinky LED" program.

Issues along the way:
--------------------
The CMSIS-DAP Device wasn't visible under Control Panel->Devices and Printers.

This turned out to be due to the way I downloaded the latest .if file to update the mbed's firmware.

Referring to the links on this page:

    https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Firmware-LPC1768-LPC11U24

Left- or right-clicking here:

    https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/samux/mbedmicrontroller_141212.if

produces a truncated (= 80-90 kB) .if file, which unfortunately (silently falsely) 
appears to succeed when the user attempts to use it to update the Firmware.

I found that left-clicking on the "..." here:

    rev 141212 [ ... ] 

does download a 133 kB .if file.

Findings along the way:
----------------------
There were several "Options for Target 'mbed NXP LPC1768'" that tempted me to modify them, 
which I came to reget, as they cause various kinds of grief, i.e., they prevent either the 
downloading of the program, or the debugging of it.

I list these "tempting" settings and their "functional" values below, save all of us future 
grief.

These are all accessible by either of:

	Right-click on Project Tree->"mbed NXP LPC1768"->
	"Options for target ..."

	Click on the "Magic Wand" (= Options for Target...) button in the Build Toolbar.

Device: none
Target: none
Output: none
Listing: none

User:
	none
	Interestingly, the "Start Debugging" checkbox does auto-start the Debugger 
	after a Build, but not just when the "Load" button is clicked.

C/C++: none
Asm: none
Linker: none

Debug:
	Use CMSIS-DAP Debugger->Settings->-Debug->Debug Box->Stop after Bootloader, when 
	unchecked, says: "Cannot access target.".

	Use CMSIS-DAP Debugger->Settings->-Debug->Download Options Box->Download to Flash, 
	when checked, says: "Illegal address." at Debugging start-up.

	Use CMSIS-DAP Debugger->Settings->Flash Download->Download Function Box->Reset and Run, 
	doesn't seem to have any effect one way or the other.

Q: What does the "Reset and Run" checkbox do?
