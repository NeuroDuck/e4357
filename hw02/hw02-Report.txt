Assignment #2 Report:
-------------------

This assignment took somewhere between xx-xx hours.

Issues along the way:
--------------------
sudo apt-get install tcsh

Findings along the way:
----------------------
In tcsh:
set a=b.c
echo $a:r # prints b
echo $a:e # prints c
Using $1:r and $1:e in tcsh, make it easier to write
generic compile scripts.

Yes, you are right, Clifff like you'd asked in a prev email you'll need the mbed Windows Serial driver from here:
http://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration


Timer Findings along the way:
----------------------
LPC1768 has 4 Counter/Timers.
They have 2 or 4 Capture(CAP) inputs,
      and 2 or 4 Match(MAT)   outputs.
Int on Match, 
Stop counting on Match, w/optional Int.
Reset timer on match, w/optional Int.
MAT outputs can be set low/high/toggle/nochange on Match.
Count externally-supplied clock.
Four Match registers.
Four Capture inputs, to trap timer value when an input 
signal transitions.

My Pin = 27 = P0[11].

Providing my Input Signal from my 'scope's Signal Generator, as shown in the checked in photo.


Results/Solutions:
-----------------

My hw02.cpp comments explain my current thought process.

I'll on it further as time permits.
