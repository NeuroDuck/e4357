Assignment #3 Report:
-------------------

This assignment took about 15 hours, mostly getting the inter-MCU communication working, 
due to adding various print statements to diagnose wires plugged in incorrectly, typing
errors in entering the code, etc. 

Issues along the way:
--------------------
Wiring up the two MCU's consistently, and for easy debugging.
I.e., using green wire associated with a green LED, and 
red wire associated with a red LED, and adding "GREEN" and "RED" 
to #define constants, to simplify debugging.

Findings along the way:
----------------------
There doesn't seem to be any straightforward-to-use Terminal program for Macs.
At least, none of the several we tried worked.

To test, we went through the Truth Table (00, 01, 10, 11) of inputs on both MCU's, 
and confirmed via printf()'s and the LED states, that the correct signals were 
being received and interpreted on the other MCU, in both directions.

Starting from Sample code here:
------------------------------
Embedded_Systems-book.pdf, pg. 135.

Results/Solutions:
-----------------
My hw03.cpp adds to the sample code on pg. 135, by making it easier to debug 
any mis-signaling between the two MCU's.

I'll work on an I2C version of it further as time permits.
