-----------------------

How to: 
use VirtualBox shared image.
use github.com.
use Google Shared Groups.
use arm-none-eabi-gcc, -objdump, etc. in shared VirtualBox image.
add myself to the vboxsf group, so I can write to my Windows C: drive.
not use USB3, to void Blue Screens.
use workflow that writes .bin directly to my LPC1763, avoiding BSOD's.
use gcc -E to expand the macros in LPC17xx.h, so a line like:
 LPC_GPIO0->FIOPIN &= ~pinMask;
is expanded into something like:
    ((LPC_GPIO_TypeDef *) ((0x2009C000UL) + 0x0) )->FIODIR &= ~dirMask;
to better be able to match up the above with the Addressing Modes used in the Assembly Language statements.
find the correspondences between the pNN numbers on the LPC1768, and the Pn[bb] Port and Bit numbers in the programming model.
decode the bitfield meanings, as shown in my hw01-Report.txt.
